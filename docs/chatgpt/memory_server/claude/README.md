# Claude Client Interactions

Records of attempts to install and authenticate MCP servers using the `claude` client.

- `install_no_oauth.md` – successful Supermemory server installation using direct API key with OAuth disabled.
- `install_oauth_fail.md` – failed Supermemory installation due to missing authentication flow when OAuth was requested.
- `install_filesystem.md` – successful installation of the local filesystem MCP server.
