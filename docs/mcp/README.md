# MCP Catalog

This catalog enumerates the Model Context Protocol servers that were
installed or attempted during development. Each entry captures the
client used, endpoint, installation status, and available functions.

The accompanying `catalog.json` file is generated by
`modules/mcp_catalog/main.py` and can be regenerated with:

```
python modules/mcp_catalog/main.py
```
